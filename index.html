            <p>Welcome to my personal profile. I am currently a intern at DVT how loves
            to learn and gain knowlegde when ever I can. Building software is what I want
            to do for the rest of my life. So what do you want to know about me. First I 
            am 21 year old, turning 22 in October. My primary school was Raytin laerskool and I went to two high school, Cullinan High School and CVO Pretoria. Further more I am a hard working person and love to solve problems. I played chess from the age 7 to 17 and this is where my love for solving problems came. I represented South Africa, in chess, at the age of 17. So, yeah that is my bio for now. I hope to update it soon with more content regarding software and building applications for DVT</p>
